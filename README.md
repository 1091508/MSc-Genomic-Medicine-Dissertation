The first file, entitled Cell Profiler Image Analysis Pipeline, is a .cppipe file containing the modules executed in Cell Profiler to 
analyze images taken on the Opera Phenix confocal microscope. The second file, called Image Analysis Data Quantification, is a .R file containing
the R script used to clean, analyze, and visualize data from the Image Analysis Pipeline. The update history for Image Analysis Data Quantification.R 
redacts the author's first name from filepaths, so please refrain from accessing the update history. You will see that the timing of the most recent 
update is prior to the dissertation submission deadline of 12:00 BST, August 7th, 2025.
